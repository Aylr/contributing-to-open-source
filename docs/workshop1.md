# Contributing To Open Source

## First Steps: Setup accounts and install tools

1. Sign up for a [GitHub](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)
2. Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
3. Download and install [Anaconda Python 3.6](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows) **Be sure to choose the Python 3.6 version**

## Terminology

- **version control**
    + [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics)
        * what is it
        * what does it enable?
- **repository**
    + This is the place your code is stored.
- **branch**
    + A branch is a smart copy of a codebase that knows about it's history. You typically create a branch of your own to do work on. This is your workspace that is compelete safe to experiment with.
- **master branch**
    + This is typically used as the production code and usually has protections on it to prevent contributors from directly interfering with it.
- **commit**
    + This is a save point.
- **diff**
    + This is a way to see the differences between different points in time.
- **local vs remote**
    + Work is done in your local computer. The remote is the server where everyone's work (including yours) is backed up to.
- **pushing to remote**
    + Pushing commits is the act of syncing your local commits and backing them up to the remote server. This allows others to see your work.
- **pulling**
    + This syncs changes from the server to your local repository.
- **pull request**
    + Once you have done work, committed it and pushed it, you'll create a *pull request*. This is a signal and way to communicate to the maintainer that you've done work and it's ready for review.
- **code review**
    + Collaborators like to check each other's work to ensure quality. This is a way for experienced engineers to mentor, and a way to share knowledge.
- **merge**
    + Once a code review has taken place and it is determined that the work should be integrated into the production codebase, a merge is done.

## Workflow

## Helpful Tips

- Many open source projects keep issue lists (bugs, improvements, new features, etc). These are a great way to find things that you can do (or want to learn to do). Some projects even intentionally label easier issues as *help wanted* as a guide to less experienced users.
- Contact maintainers!
    + Many have email lists, forumns and slack channels. You'll be surprised how willing most are to help new contributors.
- Read the **README**s. They are usually very helpful. Sometimes you'll find ways to improve them. Do it!
- Read the **CONTRIBUTING** document that most repos have. This will help you get your development environment set up and help you understand their specific process.
