# Workflow

We are going to walk through the entire process of contributing to an open source project starting at the very beginning.

## Before we start...

You'll need some tools, so please follow the instructions in [First Steps Install Tools](first_steps_install_tools.md). Also remember to use the [terminology](terminology.md) as a reference to help you soar through the jargon.

## Let's do it!

1. Fork the repo
2. Pick an issue
3. Create a branch
4. Do the work
5. Commit your changes
6. Push your changes to the server
7. Create a pull request - aka PR
8. Celebrate the barrier you just broke
