# Helpful Tips

- Many open source projects keep issue lists (bugs, improvements, new features, etc). These are a great way to find things that you can do (or want to learn to do). Some projects even intentionally label easier issues as *help wanted* as a guide to less experienced users.
- Contact maintainers!
    + Many have email lists, forumns and slack channels. You'll be surprised how willing most are to help new contributors.
- Read the **README**s. They are usually very helpful. Sometimes you'll find ways to improve them. Do it!
- Read the **CONTRIBUTING** document that most repos have. This will help you get your development environment set up and help you understand their specific process.
